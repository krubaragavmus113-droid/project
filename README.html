Project Title: KRUBA RAGAV'S Personal Portfolio
This project is a personal portfolio website designed to showcase my skills, projects, and provide a way for potential employers or collaborators to contact me. The site is a static web page built using fundamental front-end technologies.

Project Features
The website is divided into several key sections, each accessible from the navigation bar at the top:

Home Section: This is the landing page of the site. It features a welcoming headline and a brief description introducing me as a first-year B.Tech student. This section sets the tone for the entire portfolio.

About Me Section: This page provides a short, personal biography. It describes my passion for exploring new technologies and applying them in real-world projects. It also includes a placeholder for a personal photo.

Projects Section: This area highlights several projects I have worked on. Each project is presented in its own card with a title and a brief description. Examples include "Creating a personal budget," "Planning a week's worth of meals," and "Starting a small garden."

Contact Me Section: This form allows visitors to easily get in touch. It includes input fields for their name, email, and a message. A "Send" button is provided to submit the information.

Technologies Used
The project is built using the following core technologies:

HTML: The entire structure and content of the website are created using HTML. This includes the navigation bar, section dividers, text, images, and the contact form.

CSS: All the styling is handled with CSS. This includes the color scheme (blue, green, purple, and a light pink/red border), the layout of the sections, font styles, and the rounded corners on the content blocks.

How to View the Project
To view this portfolio website, you simply need a web browser.

Download or clone the project files.

Open the index1.html file directly in your web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).

Future Improvements
I plan to continue improving this portfolio by:

Adding more detailed descriptions and images for each project.

Integrating a back-end service to make the contact form fully functional.

Making the website responsive to ensure it looks great on mobile devices.
